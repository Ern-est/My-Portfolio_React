Portfolio Website Progress (April 29, 2025)
Today’s updates focused on polishing the Hero section and overall UI layout:

✅ What's Done
🎨 Full-page Gradient Background
Applied a custom gradient background using #0a0a23, #1e1e3f, and #020617 for a smooth vertical blend matching the original design.

📱 Hero Section Revamp

Separated Hero into two sides: content (left) and image (right).

Styled the Hero image to appear behind the text (visually like a background).

Increased text size and spacing to reflect the design mockups.

Logos (React, Supabase, Flutter, Firebase) now spread evenly across the full Hero width.

🖼️ Responsive Fixes

Prevented the Hero image from overlapping content on small screens.

Ensured content remains readable and well-aligned on all device sizes.

📄 CV Download Button

Created and centered a styled .cv-download button for future use.
